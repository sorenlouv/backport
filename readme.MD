## What is backporting?
> Backporting is the action of taking parts from a newer version of a software system or software component and porting them to an older version of the same software. It forms part of the maintenance step in a software development process, and it is commonly used for fixing security issues in older versions of the software and also for providing new features to older versions.

This tool was built to automate the following workflow:
 1) Changes are merged to master
 2) One or more commits are cherry-picked from master onto another branch
 3) The branch is pushed and a pull request is created


### Install

```
npm install -g backport
```

### Configuration

#### Global Config

The first time you run `backport` a skeleton configuration file will be created
in `/<homedir>/.backport/config.json`. You need to update the config file with
your Github username and a Github Access Token (can be created
[here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)).

<details>
<summary>View "config.json" sample</summary>

```js
{
  // Github personal access token. Create here: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
  // Please check "Full control of private repositories"
  "accessToken": "",

  // Github username, eg. kimchy
  "username": "",

  // Override project-specific setting
  "projects": [
    {
      "upstream": "elastic/kibana",
      "branches": ["6.x", "6.1", "6.0"]
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

#### Project-specific config

Add `.backportrc.json` to the root of your project with the following structure:

<details>
<summary>View ".backportrc.json" sample</summary>

```js
{
  "upstream": "elastic/kibana",

  // You can pre-select branches you use often
  "branches": [
    { "name": "6.x", "checked": true },
    { "name": "6.1", "checked": true },
    "6.0"
  ],

  // Only allow picking own commits to backport
  "own": true,

  // Backport multiple commits
  "multipleCommits": false,

  // Backport to multiple branches
  "multipleBranches": true,

  // Labels will be added to the PR
  "labels": ["backport"]
}
```

</details>

### Troubleshooting

`backport` never touches your local repositories or files. Instead a separate
clone of your repositories are created in `/<homedir>/.backport/repositories/`.
This is also where you'll need to solve merge conflicts. If you are experiencing
issues, you can try deleting the repository, or the entire `.backport` folder -
it will be recreated next time you run `backport`.
